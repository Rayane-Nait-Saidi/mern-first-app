I made a simple note web app using the MERN stack , this is my first very simple project using this stack
this app simulates a register/login page , it allows us to add notes , list them , we can delete a specific note just by clicking on it 
the user can also see its account details , he can logs out , and he can delete its account too
I think it is a good begining for me , right 😁
